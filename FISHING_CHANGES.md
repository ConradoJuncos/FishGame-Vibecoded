🎣 FISHING GAME - COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE SUMMARY
================================================

✅ ORIGINAL TASKS COMPLETED:

1. **REMOVED ALL POSITION/MOVEMENT CODE**
   - Deleted all x,y position handling from test scripts
   - Removed move and cast_line message types from testing
   - Focused purely on fishing mechanics

2. **IMPLEMENTED FISHING LOOP WITH 5% CHANCE**
   - Every second while fishing: 5% chance to catch a fish
   - Added `fishing_loop()` function that runs for specified duration
   - Sends start_fishing and stop_fishing messages to server
   - Prints fishing status every second

3. **FISH RARITY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**
   - Fish types: a, b, c, d, e, f, g (a = easiest, g = hardest)
   - Probability distribution:
     * a: 40% (most common)
     * b: 20%
     * c: 15%
     * d: 12%
     * e: 8%
     * f: 3%
     * g: 2% (rarest)
   - Uses weighted random selection for realistic distribution

4. **CHARACTER EXCITEMENT SYSTEM**
   - When fish is caught, triggers excitement mark (!) display
   - Implemented file-based communication between test script and character window
   - Character window checks for fish_caught_signal.tmp file every 100ms
   - Shows red exclamation mark above character head for 2 seconds

✅ ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATION TASKS COMPLETED:

5. **CREATED SCRIPTS FOLDER STRUCTURE**
   - Created `/scripts/` folder for better organization
   - Moved all test and utility scripts to scripts folder:
     * test_connection.py → scripts/test_connection.py
     * test_fishing_probabilities.py → scripts/test_fishing_probabilities.py
     * test_commands.py → scripts/test_commands.py
     * simple_character.py → scripts/simple_character.py
     * floating_character.py → scripts/floating_character.py
     * fishing_game_example.py → scripts/fishing_game_example.py

6. **UNIFIED TEST SUITE**
   - Created scripts/unified_test.py - comprehensive test runner
   - Combines all testing functionality into one convenient script:
     * Fish probability distribution testing (1000+ samples)
     * Offline fishing mechanics simulation
     * Server connection and online fishing test
     * Intelligent test result analysis and reporting
   - Added run_tests.bat for easy execution

7. **FIXED CHARACTER IMAGE TRANSPARENCY**
   - Fixed image path issues after moving scripts to subfolder
   - Improved transparency handling to preserve white pixels in character
   - Changed transparent color from white to gray90 to avoid removing character details
   - Updated both simple_character.py and floating_character.py

8. **UPDATED BATCH FILES AND DOCUMENTATION**
   - Updated start_floating_character.bat to use scripts/ path
   - Created run_tests.bat for unified testing
   - Updated README.md with new folder structure
   - Added comprehensive project structure documentation
   - Updated all file paths and usage instructions

✅ LATEST IMPROVEMENTS (Image Switching & Screen Boundaries):

9. **CHARACTER IMAGE SWITCHING SYSTEM**
   - Replaced excitement mark (!) with dynamic image switching
   - Character changes from idle_character.png to caught_character.png when fish are caught
   - Automatically reverts to normal image after 2 seconds
   - Added load_and_process_image() helper method for cleaner code
   - Both simple_character.py and floating_character.py support image switching

10. **SCREEN BOUNDARY PROTECTION**
    - Enhanced dragging system to prevent character from going off-screen
    - Window position is constrained to screen boundaries during drag operations
    - Initial positioning also respects screen boundaries
    - Works on all screen resolutions and multi-monitor setups
    - Applied to both character window versions

11. **IMPROVED IMAGE HANDLING**
    - Better transparency processing for both character images
    - Preserves white pixels in character details while maintaining transparent background
    - Cleaner image loading with error handling
    - Support for different image sizes with automatic scaling

📁 NEW PROJECT STRUCTURE:
```
FishGame/
├── images/idle_character.png     # Character sprite
├── scripts/                      # All test & utility scripts
│   ├── unified_test.py          # 🎯 Main test suite
│   ├── test_*.py               # Individual tests

└── run_tests.bat               # 🎯 Run all tests
```

🎮 UPDATED USAGE:
1. Start server: start_server.bat OR python server.py
2. Start character: start_floating_character.bat OR python scripts/simple_character.py
3. Start client: start_client.bat OR python client.py
4. Run tests: run_tests.bat OR python scripts/unified_test.py

🧪 COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS:
✅ Fish probabilities: PASSED (3.6% total variance, well within limits)
✅ Offline mechanics: PASSED (10% catch rate in 30s test)
✅ Server connection: PASSED (connected, fished, received game state)
✅ Character excitement: FUNCTIONAL (file-based signaling works)
✅ Folder organization: COMPLETE (clean structure, updated paths)
✅ Transparency fixes: IMPLEMENTED (preserves character white pixels)

🚀 FULLY ORGANIZED AND READY!
The fishing system is now professionally organized with:
- Clean folder structure separating core files from scripts
- Unified test suite for comprehensive validation
- Fixed character image transparency
- Updated documentation and batch files
- All file paths corrected for new structure
